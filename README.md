Leveraging a design document brings clear direction to development, highlighting potential obstacles and addressing key factors. Enhancing the document could involve a greater focus on user experience and the inclusion of visual representations such as mock-ups. Design decisions were largely influenced by the user's unique game requirements, underscoring the critical nature of user contentment. Going forward, the design process will prioritize regular input from stakeholders, cyclic prototyping, user validation, and the use of segmented tools for streamlined component handling.
